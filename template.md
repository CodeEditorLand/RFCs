## Objective
Describe the objective in one sentence.

## Motivation
Why would we do something like this? Please describe the needs it addresses.

## User Benefit
What will users of Tauri (whether core-developers, dev consumers or app users) gain from this?

## Design Proposal

### Solution
Please go into gory detail about how this should work. Pseudocode is acceptable.

### Alternatives Considered
What other options are out there?

### Performance Implications
Describe how this change may impact performance?

### Dependencies
Will new dependencies be introduced? Will stale projects need to be forked or assimilated?

### Engineering Impact
Will this increase or decrease build times, developer workload etc.?

### Platforms and Environments
Please consider that core tauri should "just work" on all currently supported platforms. An RFC that only
addresses one platform is not a good candidate.

### Security Impact
What changes will this bring, if any, to the security model of CI, developers and users?

### Tutorials and Examples
What kind of training materials should be made available?

### Compatibility
Will this introduce breaking changes?

### User Impact
Will user's be impacted in any way?
