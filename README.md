# Tauri RFC Repository
This repo is dedicated to an RFC process, through which we have significant changes to the project undergo a transparent consideration and confirm changes by accepting them into the repo.

## Process
1) **Start a discussion.** Writing an RFC is a large investment of time, it's best to discuss it with the community to be sure it's worthwhile and to get it done right.
2) **Fork this repo.** The review period of RFCs is held in the PR back into the repo.
3) **Copy the template.** Move your copy of `template.md` into the `texts` folder, naming it in the scheme of `0000-feature.md`. Note: the number is literal, it needs to be adjusted just before merging.
4) **Fill the template out.** Replace all relevant sections with explanations. Put care into the details, as it will serve as a reference through the development process.
5) **Open a PR.** At this point, the RFC is open for comment. Discussion should happen in the comments of the PR. RFCs that are "invalid" (don't follow the format/proceedure, violate CoC, or are otherwise unable to be used) may be closed immediately, otherwise they will be left open for a minimum of 2 weeks before being accepted or rejected.
6) **After the comment period,** a member of the Core Team will handle closing the RFC. If accepted, the RFC will be assigned a number and a tracking issue opened on the appropriate repo. Both details will be added to the RFC, then the PR will be merged.
